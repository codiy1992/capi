# HTTP(S) and SOCKS4(A)/SOCKS5 server on the same port
# mixed-port: 7890

# authentication of local SOCKS5/HTTP(S) server
# authentication:
#  - "user1:pass1"
#  - "user2:pass2"

# Set to true to allow connections to the local-end server from
# other LAN IP addresses
allow-lan: true

# This is only applicable when `allow-lan` is `true`
# '*': bind all IP addresses
# 192.168.122.11: bind a single IPv4 address
# "[aaaa::a8aa:ff:fe09:57d8]": bind a single IPv6 address
bind-address: "*"

# Clash router working mode
# rule: rule-based packet routing
# global: all packets will be forwarded to a single endpoint
# direct: directly forward the packets to the Internet
mode: rule

# Clash by default prints logs to STDOUT
# info / warning / error / debug / silent
log-level: info

# When set to false, resolver won't translate hostnames to IPv6 addresses
ipv6: false

# RESTful web API listening address
external-controller: 0.0.0.0:9090

# A relative path to the configuration directory or an absolute path to a
# directory in which you put some static web resource. Clash core will then
# serve it at `http://{{external-controller}}/ui`.
# external-ui: folder

# Secret for the RESTful API (optional)
# Authenticate by spedifying HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer ${secret}`
# ALWAYS set a secret if RESTful API is listening on 0.0.0.0
# secret: ""

# Outbound interface name
# interface-name: en0

# Static hosts for DNS server and connection establishment (like /etc/hosts)
#
# Wildcard hostnames are supported (e.g. *.clash.dev, *.foo.*.example.com)
# Non-wildcard domain names have a higher priority than wildcard domain names
# e.g. foo.example.com > *.example.com > .example.com
# P.S. +.foo.com equals to .foo.com and foo.com
hosts:
  # '*.clash.dev': 127.0.0.1
  # '.dev': 127.0.0.1
  # 'alpha.clash.dev': '::1'

profile:
  # Store the `select` results in $HOME/.config/clash/.cache
  # set false If you don't want this behavior
  # when two different configurations have groups with the same name, the selected values are shared
